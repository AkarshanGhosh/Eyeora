# Eyeora 👁️  
**Smarter Surveillance. Smarter Insights.**

---

## 🌍 What is Eyeora?  
Eyeora is a next-generation **AI-powered surveillance platform** designed to go beyond the limits of conventional CCTV cameras. While traditional CCTV systems only record passive video and existing smart cameras are often expensive and tied to proprietary cloud services, Eyeora brings a **customizable, affordable, and intelligent alternative**.

With Eyeora, every camera stream becomes more than just footage—it becomes **actionable intelligence**.

## 🎯 Our Aim  
- To design a **low-cost smart security camera** powered by the ESP32-CAM and future IoT devices.  
- To build a **secure web platform** that streams live video directly, without depending on third-party cloud services.  
- To integrate **real-time machine learning (YOLO-based models)** for object detection, event alerts, and behavioral analysis.  
- To create a **scalable AI surveillance ecosystem** that adapts to homes, offices, shops, hospitals, and beyond.

## 🚀 Our Ambitions  
1. **Live Feed Anywhere, Anytime**  
   Stream camera data directly to your secure website/app using unique IDs, accessible globally.  

2. **Intelligent Object Detection**  
   Detect intrusions, suspicious activities, or predefined objects using real-time AI models.  

3. **Dynamic Insights Beyond Security**  
   - Retail analytics: count customers, detect window shoppers vs buyers.  
   - Healthcare monitoring: patient activity tracking & alerts.  
   - Industrial use cases: drone surveillance, rover monitoring, and more.  

4. **Affordable & Customizable**  
   Unlike closed, subscription-heavy smart cameras, Eyeora focuses on **open, cost-effective, and user-driven design**.
