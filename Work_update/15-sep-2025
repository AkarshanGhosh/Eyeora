Eyeora Project Progress Notes Sential Vision System

Prepared by: Akarshan Ghosh (Akku)

1️⃣ Backend Setup

Framework: FastAPI

Server running on local machine:

Detects LAN/Wi-Fi connection using psutil.

If LAN is connected → shows Eyeora backend homepage with API docs link.

If no LAN → redirects to Wi-Fi config page (SSID/password input).

IP Handling:

get_ip_addresses() prints all IPs (localhost + LAN/hotspot) for easy access.

Uvicorn runs on 0.0.0.0, making the backend accessible for devices on the same network.

Frontend-ready: Homepage is user-friendly and visually styled.

2️⃣ Network / Hotspot

Confirmed: Backend works over laptop hotspot.

Devices (ESP32-CAM, ESP32 Dev Board, phones) can send data as long as hotspot is active.

LAN vs Hotspot:

LAN connected → backend runs normally.

LAN disconnected → redirects to Wi-Fi config page.

IP addresses: Terminal prints all relevant access URLs for local & network access.

3️⃣ Backend Modular Update

Added upload endpoints for testing with frontend:

/upload_image → stores images in uploads/images/.

/upload_video → stores videos in uploads/videos/.

Folders are automatically created if they don’t exist.

File naming includes timestamp + original filename to avoid conflicts.

Endpoints ready to receive uploads from React frontend.

4️⃣ Frontend Plan & Structure

Purpose: Temporarily replace ESP32-CAM live feed with user-uploaded videos/images.

React app features:

Upload images/videos via POST API calls to backend.

Display success messages after upload.

Later: fetch YOLO detection results and display bounding boxes/overlays.

5️⃣ Backend & Frontend Integration Flow

User opens frontend → selects image/video → uploads to backend.

Backend saves file in proper folder (uploads/images/ or uploads/videos/).

Future: YOLO model processes the file and returns detections.

Frontend displays processed results (bounding boxes, detected objects, video frames with overlay).

6️⃣ YOLO Model (Next Phase)

Not implemented yet; currently we have placeholders for future integration.

Planned steps:

Add dummy YOLO endpoint → returns sample detection data for frontend testing.

Replace dummy with real YOLO detection once model is integrated.

Support both images and videos.

7️⃣ Project Modularization

Server.py → main app, LAN/hotspot detection, homepage, Wi-Fi config.

Uploads endpoints → separate logic for image/video uploads.

Folder structure:

Eyeora/
├─ Server/
│  ├─ server.py
│  ├─ endpoints/       # future expansion (YOLO, ESP32 endpoints)
│  ├─ uploads/
│  │   ├─ images/
│  │   └─ videos/

8️⃣ Achievements Today

Backend fully running locally with IP access info.

LAN/hotspot detection implemented.

Fancy backend homepage and Wi-Fi config page.

File upload endpoints created for frontend testing.

React frontend structure and API integration plan ready.

Confirmed backend can receive data over hotspot network, simulating real IoT workflow.

9️⃣ Next Phase (Tomorrow / Future)

React frontend integration:

Upload images/videos and test backend endpoints.

Display confirmation and later YOLO results.

Dummy YOLO endpoint:

Return sample detections for uploaded images/videos.

File management enhancements:

Automatically clean old frames/videos.

YOLO integration:

Integrate real YOLO model for images & videos.

Return bounding boxes & confidence scores to frontend.

ESP32 integration (later):

ESP32-CAM → send live frames via POST / API.

ESP32 Dev → send battery %, sensor readings, servo commands.

Optional advanced features:

WebSocket streaming for near real-time video.

User/device authentication.

Dashboard for monitoring system status and detections.

🔹 Summary

Today we completed backend foundation: network detection, homepage, Wi-Fi config, and upload endpoints.

Frontend will allow testing of uploads and YOLO workflow without needing the actual camera.

Next session: connect frontend → backend → dummy YOLO results, completing the testing loop before ESP32 integration.
